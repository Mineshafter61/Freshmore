# W1D1 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics

## Definitions

### Probability vs Statistics

- **Probability** is a mathematical method to quantify the *chance* of
something happening, using a number between 0 and 1
- **Statistics** is the science of collecting, analysing, and interpreting
*data*, in order to extract meaningful information and conclusions

### Population vs Sample

- **Population** is the collection of all individual items of a particular type
- **Sample** is a sub-collection of the population, selected in some manner
    - Getting *sample data from population data* uses **probability**
    - Inferring *population data from the sample data* involves  **statistics**

### Observational vs Experimental

- **Observational** studies usually involve a sample survey
- **Experimental** studies involve researchers actively intervening to control the study conditions
    - i.e Determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment/drug

### Sampling Errors & Survey Design

- **Sampling errors** come from any sample in a survey being very unlikely to represent the true population
- **Selection bias** comes from not targeting a representative set of respondents
