**Sample mean**, $\bar{x}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$
Sample mean and data value identity: $\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})=0$
**Sample median**: Sort the values in increasing (or decreasing) order. If  is odd, then the median is the middle number of the sorted values; if  is even, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
**Mode**: value that appears most often in a data set.
**Skew**
    - If it a unimodal graph is **symmetric**, then the **mean, median and mode all coincide**.
    - If the **left tail of the graph is longer** (than the right tail), then the graph is said to be **skewed to the left**; if the **right tail is longer**, then the graph is **skewed to the right**.
**Robustness**: sensitivity to extremely large or extremely small values. If a value is sensitive, it is not robust, and vice versa.
**Sample variance**: $s_x^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i-1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$
**Sample standard deviation**: $s_x=+\sqrt{s_x^2}$
Interquartile range: Q3 - Q1
**Sample covariance**: $s_{xy}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$
**Sample correlation coefficient**: $r_{xy}=\frac{s_{xy}}{s_{x}s_{y}}$
