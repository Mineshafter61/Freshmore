## Types of Polymer
- Natural
	- Protein
	- DNA/RNA
- Synthetic (Plastics)
	- Nylon
	- Polyester
	- Acrylic
	- Polystyrenes (styrofoam)
## Common functional groups for SSW
- R-group: 
	- variable part of a molecule that can change while the rest of the molecular structure remains constant.
	- can be as simple as a single hydrogen atom (H) or a more complex arrangement of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
	- may also contain other elements like oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), or halogens
## Polymerization Reactions
- Polymers: a long chain of monomers connected together by covalent bonds
- n: degree of polymerization (number of repeating units)
### Addition Polymerization
- Monomers react to form a polymer chain without net loss of atoms.
- also called **chain-growth polymers**
- Usually happens with monomers with C=C
- Ingredients:
	- Initiator: Reactive species that breaks apart in heat/UV (e.g. Hydrogen Peroxide, H-O-O-H)
	- Monomer
- Steps:
	- **Initiation**: small concentration of molecules that have weak bonds
	- **Propagation**: radicals react with other monomers to form covalent bonds, linking them together and extending the polymer chain
	- **Termination** by radical reaction or hydrogen atom transfer
### Condensation polymerization
- A small molecule (frequently water) is **split off** as each monomer unit is attached to the growing polymer
- Usually 2 different monomers
	- Monomer 1 has $\ce{RC_2OH}$
	- Monomer 2 has $\ce{R-N-H}$, $\ce{R-O-H}$, ...
- formed when monomers link by a **dehydration-condensation** type reaction
- The monomers of condensation polymers have two functional groups, and each monomer can link to two others
- Example: Ester bonds
### Degree of Polymerisation
- The number of repeating units, n, in the polymer chain is the degree of polymerisation
	- **Must be a whole number**
	- Unitless
- Molecular weight of a polymer (M,<sub>i</sub>): average mass of one mole of chains (6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules)
## Characteristics of Polymers
### Arrangement
- **Linear**: single continuous chain of repeat units.
- **Branched**: same repeat units are branches off the main chains
- **Crosslinked**: individual linear polymer chain is connected to every other chain through a path of covalent bonds.
### Polymer Structure
- **Crystalline**: Regularly aligned chains
	- usually opaque (scatter light)
- **Amorphous**: Random, disorganized cells
	- clearer (more light can go through)
	- Usually branched polymers (not crosslinked)
- **Semi-crystalline**
	- exist on a scale between amorphous and crystalline
### $T_g$ (glass transition)
- For **amorphous polymers** and **semi-crystalline polymers**
- Temperature above which material transitions from glassy to rubbery state.
- **Glassy State**: Hard, stiff, brittle like glass
- **Rubbery State**: Soft, compliant, extensible
- When temperature = $T_g$, **intermolecular interactions** are overcome, therefore it becomes rubbery.
- Remains at rubbery state for a **long range of temperature**
- Does not change into liquid instantly
- Only the amorphous molecules in a semi-crystalline polymer experience change in phase state at glass transition temperature.
- The crystalline portion remains crystalline during the glass transition.
- The rubbery state lends softness and flexibility to a polymer.
### $T_m$ (melting temperature)
- For **(semi)crystalline polymers**
- **Sharp melting point**, $T_m$
- increased by **double bonds and large side groups** in the polymer chain, as they restrict the flexibility of the chain.
## Types of Plastics
### Thermoplastic
- Composition: Long chain polymers created through **addition polymerization**
- Interactions: Long chain polymer held together by weak **van der Waals forces**
- Heat Response: Thermoplastics melt or soften when heated, allowing them to be molded and then cooled, which makes them **highly recyclable**
- Glass Transition Temperature (Tg): Below Tg, the weak van der Waals interactions re-form, making the material **rigid and glassy**
### Thermoset
- Composition: Long chain polymers created through **condensation polymerization**
- Interactions: Held together by **strong covalent cross-links**
- Heat Response:
	- Cross-links do not break upon heating, providing greater thermal stability than thermoplastics
	- **Not recyclable**, cannot be remolded or reformed upon heating
	- Can have Tg, but they **do not soften or melt above this temperature** due to their cross-linked structure
- Stiffness & melting point of the plastic **increases with the number of cross-links** in the structure
## Biodegradable Plastics
- Biodegradable Plastics have **ester bonds** because microbes are willing to work on them.
- Degrades through **solvolysis**
- Solvolysis is a chemical reaction where a **compound (solute) reacts with the solvent**, leading to the **substitution** or **elimination** of a part of the solute molecule. The solvent often acts as a reactant, influencing the reaction mechanism and rate.
- Types: 
  - Hydrolysis: solvent is water
  - Alcoholysis: solvent is alcohol
- **Rates** vary with **bond stability**
- Each plastic has a specified timeframe and disposal environment for biodegradation
### Breaking of Ester Bond via Hydrolysis
- **Endothermic reaction**
- **Microbes produce the appropriate conditions** for biodegradation to occur.
  - i.e. compostable
- PLA will show signs of biodegradation in **6 months** with appropriate conditions.
- PLA industrial composting conditions:
  - Temp > 60˚C
  - Relative humidity > 90%
  - 60-80 days
### Pyrolysis
- Burning plastics **with the absence of oxygen**
- Heat **breaks down long-chain polymer molecules** in the plastic into smaller hydrocarbons.
- Produces
  - Gases: Light hydrocarbons (e.g. methane, ethane)
  - Liquid oils: Pyrolysis oil; can be refined into fuels or chemical feedstock.
  - Solid residues: Char or carbon black, used in industrial applications.
- Temperature ranging from **300–900°C** is required.
