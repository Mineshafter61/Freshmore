# 3_Thermochemistry

- **Thermochemistry**: branch of chemistry concerned with the quantities of **heat** evolved or absorbed during chemical reactions.
- **System**: the part of the universe we are focusing on.
- **Surroundings**: everything else

## Internal energy

- **Sum** of all energies in a system
- For a closed system: $\Delta E=E_{final}-E_{initial}=E_{products}-E_{reactants}$
  - For this class: function of temperature $T$ and other things
- $E$ is a **state** function
  - Function independent of path (final - initial)
  - e.g. Distance vs displacement:
    - Distance: dependent on path
    - Displacement: independent of path (hence state function)

## 1st Law of Thermodynamics

[[12_Thermodynamics#First Law of Thermodynamics]]

- Law of **conservation of energy**: $\Delta E=E_2-E_1=q+w$
- 3 forms of energy:
  - Internal energy
  - Heat ($q$)
  - Work ($w$)
- When heat is entering the system: positive energy
- When work is done on the system: positive energy

## Enthalpy ($H$)

- Enthalpy $H=E+PV$
- Constant pressure: $\Delta H=\Delta E+P\Delta V$
- For **solution** at constant pressure: $\Delta H=q$
- Heat capacity ($c$): the amount of heat/energy to raise the temperature of 1g of substance by $\Delta T$
  - $c=\frac{q}{m\Delta T}$
- $\Delta H$ can be obtained by **measuring** heat absorbed or released at constant pressure for a reaction: $\Delta H=q_p=mc\Delta T$ for system

### Enthalpy of a reaction ($\Delta H_{rxn}$)

- The net amount of **_heat_** absorbed or released during a chemical reaction
- **Endothermic**: absorbs heat; heat flows into the system ($ΔH_{rxn} > 0$)
- **Exothermic**: releases heat; heat flows out of the system ($ΔH_{rxn} < 0$)
- Related to
  - bonds formation
  - bond breaking
  - intermolecular interactions (e.g., freezing, melting, dissolution)

### Hess's Law

- The enthalpy change of an overall process is the sum of the enthalpy change of its individual steps.
- Treat each individual step as a simultaneous equation

## Intensive vs Extensive Property

- **Extensive property**: depends on amount of substance
  - Volume
  - Mass
  - Enthalpy
- **Intensive property**: independent on amount of substance
  - Density
  - Temperature

## Calculating Enthalpy

### Bond energies

- Enthalpy of chemical reaction: difference between bond enthalpies in products and reactants

$$
\Delta H_{rxn}^{o}=\sum n\Delta H^o-\sum m\Delta H^o
$$

- the superscript <sup>o</sup> means standard state condition (1 atm for gas, 1 mol/L for solution at 1 atm)
- $n\Delta H^o$: bond broken
- $m\Delta H^o$: bond formed

### Enthalpy of formation

$$
\Delta H_{rxn}^{o}=\sum n\Delta H_f^o-\sum m\Delta H_f^o
$$

- **The $ΔH_f^o$ for an element in its most stable form is exactly 0.00 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.**
