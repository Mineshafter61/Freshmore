## Atom
- Electrically neutral, spherical, entity composed of a **positively charged central nucleus** surrounded by one or more **negatively charged electrons**
## Proton
- Mass: $1.67262 * 10^{-27} \text{kg}$ or $1.0073 \text{amu}$
- Relative charge: $+1$
## Neutron
- Mass: $1.67493 * 10^{-27} \text{kg}$ or $1.0087 \text{amu}$
- Relative charge: $0$
## Electron
- Mass: $9.10939 * 10^{-31} \text{kg}$ or $0.00055 \text{amu}$
- Relative charge: $-1$
## Elements & Isotopes
- $Z$: Atomic number; The **number of protons** that define the identity of an element
- $A$: Mass number; The **total number of protons and neutrons**
- Nuclide: Format to display elements, $^A_Z\text{Nuclide}$
	- i.e $^{23}_{11}\text{Na}$
- **Isotopes**: Same number of protons but different number of neutrons
	- Same atomic number $Z$ but different mass number $A$
	- Still the same element
	- Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14, etc
## Periodic Table
- Atomic mass: The number below the element
	- Gives the **average** mass of 1 mole ($6.023 * 10^{23}$) of that element
- Periodic tables are arranged based on:
	- **Periods** (rows)
		- Increasing atomic number
		- Each period represents a different energy level or shell ($n$) in which outermost electrons reside
	- **Groups** (columns)
		- Same number of outermost (valence) electrons
		- Elements within the same group share **similar** chemical properties
## Electrons
- Electrons that are not in the outermost shell are called **core electrons**
- Outermost electrons are called **valence electrons**.
	- They participate in chemical bonding.
- Electron shells follow the following configuration: $s,p,d,f$, prefixed by the shell number
	- $s$ shells hold up to 2 electrons
	- $p$ shells hold up to 6 electrons
	- $d$ shells hold up to 10 electrons
	- $f$ shells hold up to 14 electrons
- Representation for $F$: $1s^22s^22p^5$ or $[He]2s^22p^5$ (**noble gas configuration**)
	- Fluorine is in the 5th group in the p block.
- Representation for $S$: $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4$ or $[Ne] 3s^2 3p^4$
	- Sulfur is in the 4th group in the p block.
### Rules for Filling Orbitals
- **Build-up (or Aufbau) principle** is used to guide successive filling of subshells with electrons in a specific order.
	- generally filling orbitals from **lowest to highest energy**.
	- energies are total energy of atom rather than energy of subshells alone.
- **Hund’s rule** states that electrons fill **subshells singly first** with parallel spins.
- **Pauli exclusion principle** states that within one orbital, electrons must have opposite spin and one orbital can hold **maximum of two electrons** with opposite spins.
- All the rules combined, the order of filling orbitals is as follows:
	1. 1s
	2. 2s
	3. 2p, 3s
	4. 3p, 4s
	5. 3d, 4p, 5s
	6. 4d, 5p, 6s
	7. 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s
	8. 5f, 6d, 7p, _8s_
	- _Note: 8s is theoretical._

## Shielding Effect
- Presence of inner electrons act as a shield between outer electrons and nucleus
	- Outer electrons experience a reduced effective nuclear charge
	- Reduction in attractive forces between (+) charged nucleus and (-) charged electrons on outer energy levels
- **Effective nuclear charge**, $Z_{eff}$, is the net attractive force between the nucleus and each electron
	- $Z_{eff}=Z-\text{shielding}$
### Trends in Effective Nuclear Charge
- Across the period
	- Nuclear charge ($Z$) increases
	- Electron added to the same shell (n remains the same)
	- Increase in shielding << increase in nuclear charge
	- **Increase in $Z_{eff}$**
- Down the group
	- Nuclear charge ($Z$) increases
	- Electron added to the outer shell (n increases)
	- Increase in shielding >> increase in nuclear charge
	- **Decrease in $Z_{eff}$**
## Atomic Radius
- Distance between the **outermost electrons** and **nucleus**
- Obtained by getting the distance between two nuclei, and dividing that distance by 2.
### Trends in Atomic Radius
- Across the period
	- Increase in $Z_{eff}$
	- Outer electrons experience an increase in the attractive force from nucleus
	- **Atomic radius decreases**
- Down the group
	- Decrease in $Z_{eff}$
	- Outer electrons are added to a bigger shell and experience a decrease in attractive force from the nucleus
	- **Atomic radius increases**
## Ions & Ionic Radius
- **Cation**: Carries positive charge
	- e.g. $Li^+$
	- Always smaller than its neutral atom
- **Anion**: Carries negative charge
	- e.g. $F^-$
	- Always larger than its neutral atom
- **Isoelectric**: Two different elements having the same number and configuration of electrons
	- e.g. $Li$ and $Be^+$
## Ionisation Energy (IE)
- Minimum energy required to remove the highest-energy (outermost) electron from an atom or ion in the gaseous state, thereby forming a positive atom
- **Usually refers to the first ionisation energy** (IE<sub>1</sub>): the least amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a neutral atom
- **Always positive** (endothermic reaction) (IE > 0 for all cases)
	- $M_{(g)} \to M^{+}+e^{-}$: 1st ionisation energy, **IE<sub>1</sub>**
	- $M^{+}_{(g)} \to M^{2+}_{(g)}+e^{-}$: 2nd ionisation energy, **IE<sub>2</sub> > IE<sub>1</sub>**
- Successive ionisation energy **increases** as the electron is **removed from a positive ion of increasing charge**
- **Dramatic increase** occurs when the **first electron** from the **noble gas core** is removed.
### Trends
- Across the period
	- Increase in $Z_{eff}$
	- Outer electrons experience an increase in the attractive force from nucleus
	- More energy required to remove first electron
	- **IE generally increases**
- Down the group
	- Decrease in $Z_{eff}$
	- Outer electrons are added to a bigger shell and experience a decrease in attractive force from the nucleus
	- Less energy required to remove first electron
	- **IE generally decreases**
## Electron Affinity (EA)
- Energy change accompanying the **addition** of 1 mol of electrons to 1 mol of gaseous atoms or ions
	- $X_{(g)} + e^{-}\to X_{(g)}^{-}$: 1st electron affinity, EA<sub>1</sub> < 0 generally
	- $X^{-}_{(g)} + e^{-}\to X_{(g)}^{2-}$: 2nd electron affinity, EA<sub>2</sub> > 0 always
- Considering EA<sub>1</sub>, if the electron is easily attracted to the atom, EA<sub>1</sub> is **generally negative** (exothermic reaction)
- EA<sub>2</sub> and successive EAs are **always positive**
	- Energy is required (i.e. absorbed) to overcome electrostatic repulsion between anion X<sup>-</sup> and electron e<sup>-</sup>
### Trends
- Across the period
	- Increase in $Z_{eff}$
	- Added electron experience increase in attractive force from nucleus
	- More negative energy
	- **EA increases in magnitude**
- Down the group
	- Decrease in $Z_{eff}$
	- Added electrons added to larger shell and experience decrease in attractive force from nucleus
	- Less negative energy
	- **EA decreases in magnitude**
## Electronegativity (EN)
- Relative ability of a **bonded atom** to attract **shared electrons**
- Generally, high EN = high magnitude of (negative) EA
	- Increases across the period
	- Decreases down the group
