## Thermohaline Circulation
- When salty water freezes, the salts do not fit in the crystal structure of ice and is expelled.
- Surrounding saltwater gets saltier and denser.
- This denser water sinks and the surrounding saltwater moves in to fill the gap.
- These differences in water density creates currents, responsible for 90% of the water movement in ocean.
- Oceans are in dynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere
  - A warming atmosphere transfers much of the heat into the oceans
  - As the oceans circulate around the globe, heat is transported across the planet.
- Example: The thermohaline circulation transports warm water to the coastline of Western Europe
  - Postulated to be the reason why Europe's climate is up to 10°C warmer than it would normally be on the same latitude
### Worldwide current system
- At polar regions, sea ice forms and denser saltwater sinks
  – Colder, saltier (denser) water moves horizontally below the surface
– At the equator, the water at the surface move towards the poles, while water from the bottom moves up
  – Warmer, lower-salinity water moves along the surface
## Concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> with Temperature
- As water temperature increases, the ability to dissolve CO<sub>2</sub> decreases.
- With global warming, this means that more CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere.
## Net Zero
- Net zero means that the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced out by their removal from the atmosphere.
- Transportation and electric power are two main sources of CO<sub>2</sub> production.
## Biodiversity
- Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth
### 3 Levels of Biodiversity
- **Genetic diversity**: variation in genetic makeup within a species, which allows populations to adapt to changing environments.
- **Species diversity**: variety of different species in a given area, including animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. (between species)
- **Ecological/Ecosystem diversity**: variety of ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, deserts, and oceans, each with its own distinct combination of species and environmental conditions.
### 2 Components of Species Diversity
- **Species Richness**: the total number of different species inhabiting an area
- **Species Evenness**: the degree to which the number of individual organisms are evenly distributed among different species of the community
### Diversity Index
- a tool to compare the biodiversity between two or more sampling areas using a simple number.
- **Shannon Index (H)**:
  - Takes into account both the **richness** and **evenness** of the species in the community.
  - A higher number means the overall biodiversity is higher.
  - Formula: $$-\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \ln p_i$$ where
- $S$: the number of species in a community
- $p$: proportion of individuals of $i$-th species in a community ($p=\frac{n}{N}$ where $n$ is the individuals of a given type/species and $N$ is the total number of individuals in a community)
### Human Disturbance
- Tends to create winner (population increases over time) and loser (population decreases over time) species
- Winners tend to be:
  - **Generalists**, using many resources and habitats
  - Geographically widespread
  - Users of open, early successional habitats
  - Able to cope with fast-changing conditions
  - Small and fast-reproducing
  - Low on the food chain
  - Not in need of large areas of habitat
  - Mainland species
- Losers tend to be:
  - **Specialists** on certain resources or habitats
  - Limited to a small range
  - Users of mature, dense habitats
  - Needing stable conditions
  - Large and slow-reproducing
  - High on the food chain
  - Needing large areas of habitat
  - Island species
## Five Major Causes of Biodiversity Loss
1. Habitat Loss
  - single greatest threat to biodiversity
  - Caused by urban development, farming, grazing, clearing forests, and damming rivers
  - occurs through gradual, piecemeal degradation called habitat fragmentation
2. Pollution
3. Overharvesting
4. Invasive “Alien” Species
5. Climate Change
## Urban Heat Island (UHI)
- UHI occurs when a **city experiences much warmer temp than nearby rural areas**.
- Rural areas are covered with dense plants, in which water transpiration acts as nature’s air conditioner.
- The difference is to do with how well the surfaces in each environment absorb and hold heat.
### Reducing UHI
- Cover black asphalt streets, parking lots, and dark roofs with a more reflective gray coating
- Green cities, especially gardens on urban rooftops.
- Replace impervious building materials with permeable materials to promote the capture and flow of water
- Increase ventilation within the buildings through design
