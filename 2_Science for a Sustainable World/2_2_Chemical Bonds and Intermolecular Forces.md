# 2_2_Chemical Bonds and Intermolecular Forces

## Molecules

- Atoms bond with each other to form a resultant molecule which has **lower energy** and is **more stable**
  - This is done through achieving the **Octet rule** or having **8 valence electrons**
- Chemical bond is attraction between atoms

## Types of bonds

### Metallic bond

- Electrons can be shared with **all metallic atoms** in a material
  - **Attraction between metal "cations" & "sea" of valence electrons**
- Elements lose outer electrons easily (low IE, well shielded)
- Contribute their valence electrons to form delocalized electron "sea"
- Valence electrons shared amongst many other atoms
- Good electric & heat conductor, Malleable, High melting point

### Ionic bond

- Electrons can be **transferred** from from a **metal atom** to a **non-metal atom**
  - **Electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions**
- **Metals** with **low IE** lose one or more valence electrons to form a **cation**
- **Non-metals** with **high EA** gain one or more electrons to form an **anion**
- Formed between metals in Group I or II, and non-metals in Group VI or VII

### Covalent bond

- Electrons can be shared between **neighbouring atoms**
- **Greater electron density** between the nuclei of two atoms
- There can be equal or unequal sharing of electrons
- Difference in **electronegativity** dictates the "equality" of electron sharing
  - Unequal sharing of electrons shown with polar arrow OR $\delta+$ or $\delta-$
  - e.g. Fluorine's electronegativity is 4.0; Hydrogen's electronegativity is 2.1
  - HF:  $H:\delta^+ \text{ and }F:\delta^-$

## Measure of Bond Polarity

1. Difference in EN
(Table IMPORTANT)

| ∆EN        | Bond                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0          | Non-polar covalent, e.g. Cl-Cl |
| 0.1 - 0.4  | Covalent, e.g. S-H             |
| >0.4 - 1.7 | Polar covalent, e.g. H-Cl      |
| >1.7 - 3.3 | Ionic, e.g. H-F                |

2. Percent of Ionic character, $\delta$

- **Diatomic**, linear molecules
- Arbitrary cutoff at $\delta=50\%$ (IMPORTANT)
- Similar to ∆EN cutoff at 1.7 (but not the same!)
- HF and LiI are exceptions

## Bond Properties

- **Bond order**: Number of electron pairs (bonds) being shared between a given pair of atoms
  - C-C: Order 1
  - C=C: Order 2
  - C≡C: Order 3
- **Bond energy**: Energy required to overcome attraction between the nuclei and shared electrons
- **Bond length**: Distance between nuclei of the bonded atoms in the molecule
- A **higher bond order** results in a **shorter bond length** and **higher bond energy**
- Going **down the group** results in a **longer bond length** and **lower bond energy**.

## Intermolecular Interaction

| Species A               | Species B               | Strongest Possible<br>Interaction | Example                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ion                     | Ion                     | Ion-ion                           | Na<sup>+</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> |
| Ion                     | Atom/non-polar molecule | Ion-induced dipole                | Na<sup>+</sup> Cl₂ |
| Ion                     | Polar molecule          | Ion-dipole                        | Na<sup>+</sup> H₂O |
| Polar molecule          | Polar molecule          | Dipole-dipole                     | H₂O H₂O |
| Polar molecule          | Atom/non-polar molecule | Dipole-induced dipole             | H₂O Cl₂ |
| Atom/non-polar molecule | Atom/non-polar molecule | London dispersion forces          | Cl₂ Cl₂ |

## Ion-dipole interactions

- Polar molecules (dipole) will interact with both cations and anions
- Dipole's negative end will attract to cation and positive end will attract to anion

## Ion-induced dipole interactions

- Electric field from ion can induce a distortion in the electron cloud of an atom or molecule
  - For **non-polar** molecules, this induces a **temporary dipole moment**
  - For **polar** molecules, this field **enhances** existing dipole moment (see ion-dipole interactions above)
- **Polarisability**: Ease in which a particle's electron cloud is distorted
  - **Increases down the group** as atomic size increases, **large** particles are **more polarisable** as their electrons are held less tightly
  - **Decreases across the period** because of increasing $Z_{eff}$
- Cations are smaller than their parent atoms and less polarisable, anions show the opposite trend

## Dipole-dipole interactions

- Happens between **two polar molecules**
- Interaction (attraction/repulsion) depends on orientation
  - Can be attractive or repulsive
  - Based on the degree of electronegativity ($\delta^+$ or $\delta^-$)

### Hydrogen bond

- Special type of dipole-dipole interaction
- A lot stronger than other dipole-dipole interactions
- Molecule must have a **hydrogen atom** **covalently bonded** to a small, electronegative atom with **lone electron pairs**
  - Specifically, F, O, or N
  - i.e. H-F, H-O, H-N
- A lone pair is a pair of valence electrons that are not shared with another atom in a covalent bond
- Intermolecular hydrogen bonds can exist between $H$ atom of 1 molecule and the lone pair of another molecule
  - In H₂O, 2 of 6 valence electrons used for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the other 2 electron pairs are used for intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other H₂O molecules resulting in a tetrahedral arrangement

## Dipole-induced dipole interactions

- **Polar molecule** induces a dipole in an **atom or non-polar molecule** by disturbing the arrangement of electrons in the non-polar species

## London dispersion forces (AKA temporary dipole-induced dipole interactions)

- Electrons in atoms or non-polar molecules are distributed symmetrically over time
- At any instance, there may be one molecule with more electrons on one side, creating a temporary dipole
- When another molecule is sufficiently close, this temporary dipole induces a dipole in the other molecule
- **Always present**, but the **weakest** type of interaction **only effective at short range**
- Dispersion forces are **stronger** for **more polarisable** (larger) particles

## Summary of Intermolecular Interactions

- Ionic interactions
  - **Ion-dipole**: 40-600 kJ/mol: ion+polar
  - **Ion-induced dipole**: 3-15 kJ/mol: ion+non-polar
- Dipole interactions
  - **Dipole-dipole**: 5-25 kJ/mol: polar+polar
  - **Hydrogen bond**: 10-40 kJ/mol: H+F/O/N
  - **Dipole-induced dipole**: 2-10 kJ/mol: polar+non-polar
- London Dispersion: 0.05-40 kJ/mol: non-polar+non-polar

## Physical Properties

- Stronger intermolecular interactions
  - Less molecules with sufficient KE to "break free" from liquid/solid phase by overcoming intermolecular attraction
  - Lower vapor pressure
  - Higher boiling point (BP)
  - Down the group
    - Size increases
    - Polarisability increases
    - Intermolecular interactions become stronger
    - Boiling point increases
  - **Hydrogen bonds are stronger than dipole-dipole interactions**, hence water, HF and ammonia have higher BPs
- Shape affecting boiling point
  - More elongated shape: more points at which dispersion forces act
  - Higher BP
  - e.g. n-Pentane has a higher boiling point than Neopentane.
