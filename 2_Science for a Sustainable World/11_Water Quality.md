# 11_Water Quality

- Water
    - Polar molecule
    - Hydrogen bonding ($\delta+$ and $\delta-$ are relatively large, causing hydrogen bonding to be the strongest among the intermolecular interactions)
    - High specific heat capacity
    - Expands when turned into ice
    - All 3 states (solid, liquid, gas) exist naturally in the range of temperatures and pressures on Earth
- Naturally occurring water may contain
    - Inorganic ions
    - Dissolved organics
    - Dissolved gases
    - Suspended solids
    - Biological matter such as bacteria and viruses

## Chemical quality of water

- Indicators
    - pH
    - Hardness (polyvalent cations)
    - Total dissolved solids (TDS)
    - Electrical conductivity

### Water Hardness

- Total concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$ expressed as equivalent of $CaCO_3$.
- Reported as mg/L
- We take **magnesium** as **acting exactly like calcium**, i.e. 1 mol of Mg is equivalent to 1 mol of Ca.
- Example:

$$
\begin{align}
0.5g/L \text{ of }Ca^{2+}\rightarrow \frac{0.5}{40.1}=0.0125mol/L \text{ of }Ca^{2+}\\
0.4g/L \text{ of }Mg^{2+}\rightarrow \frac{0.4}{24.3}=0.0165mol/L \text{ of }Mg^{2+}
\end{align}
$$

- The 0.0165 mol/L of $MgCO^3$ is equivalent to the presence of 00165 mol/L of $CaCO^3$.
- Total $CaCO^3=0.0125+0.0165 mol/L$

## Physical quality of water

- Water is expected to be
    - Clear
    - Colourless
    - Odourless
- Parameters used to quantify physical characteristics of water include:
    - Absorption/Transmittance (Colour)
    - Turbidity (Clear)
    - Number and type of particles (Clear)

### Absorbance and Transmittance

- Absorbance: A measure of the amount of light that is absorbed by the constituents in a solution at a specified wavelength
    - Light can be absorbed by dissolved inorganic compounds and organic compounds
- **Beer-Lambert Law**: the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the **concentration** of light-absorbing molecules and the **path length** the light takes in passing through the solution

$$
\log_{10}\left({\frac{I}{I_{0}}}\right)=\ -\ \varepsilon\ C\ x=-\mathrm{A}
$$

- Where
    - $I$ = intensity of light after passing through a solution, $\mathrm{W/cm^2}$
    - $I_0$ = initial intensity of incident light before passing through solution, $\mathrm{W/cm^2}$
    - $\varepsilon$ = molar absorptivity of light-absorbing solute, $\mathrm{L/(mol \cdot cm)}$
    - $C$ = concentration of light-absorbing solute, $\mathrm{mol/L}$
    - $x$ = length of light path, $\mathrm{cm}$
    - $A$ = absorbance, dimensionless

$$
\text{Transmittance, } T=\left({\frac{I}{I_{0}}}\right)=\ 10^{-A}
$$

- Usually expressed as a percentage
- Both absorbance and transmittance are dependent on the **wavelength of light** used in the spectrometer

## New Technologies in Water Treatment: Desalination

- Requires 3.5 kWh to produce one cubic metre of desalinated water (For comparison, reservoir water requires 0.2 kWh per cubic metre).
- Energy use is expected to quadruple by 2060 using current method of desalination and anticipated growth in water demand
- Uses high pressure to push seawater through the reverse osmosis process

### New method: Electro-Deionisation (EDI)

- Energy consumption: 1.65 kWh per cubic metre
- Uses electric currents to extract the dissolved salt at ambient pressure to produce pure drinking water
    - The lower operating pressures requires lower energy consumption

### New method: Biomimicry

- Mimicking biological processes - mangrove plants extract freshwater from seawater using small amount of energy
    - Mangrove plants have aquaporin that reject Cl- ions from water.
- The mangrove plant is able to filter between 90 and 95 % of the salt at its roots using aquaporin
- Develop aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes for use in desalination plants
