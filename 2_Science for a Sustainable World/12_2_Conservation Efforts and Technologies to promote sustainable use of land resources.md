# W12D2 - Conservation Efforts and Technologies to promote sustainable use of land resources

## Living Planet Index (LPI)

- A measure of the state of the world’s biodiversity based on trends from 1970 to 2020 in over 34,836 monitored populations of 5495 vertebrate species from around the world.
- Used as an indicator of global biodiversity health and helps to highlight trends in species populations over time.
- provides a baseline to assess the effectiveness of conservation actions over time
- Helps prioritise regions and species most at risk.
- Supports policymaking for biodiversity conservation.
- Raises awareness about the urgency of addressing biodiversity loss globally.

## Conservation Efforts

- Population conservation (single species): Identifies species with declining populations to guide targeted actions.
    - Finds out why populations are declining
    - Smaller scale
- Landscape conservation: Highlights regions with significant biodiversity loss, promoting landscape-level strategies.
    - Focuses on the ecosystem
    - Larger scale

    - population size
  – genetic diversity
  – environmental factors
  – critical habitat

## Landscape conservation

- Highlights regions with **significant biodiversity loss**, promoting **landscape-level strategies**.
- Focuses on the **ecosystem**
- **Larger** scale
- Landscape conservation involves a holistic approach to preserving and managing large-scale ecosystems.
- To sustain the biodiversity of **entire communities, ecosystems and landscapes**.
- Approaches:
    - Biodiversity hotspots and protected areas (protected core areas)
    - Zoned reserves (buffer regions)
- Long-term Goals: project future pattern of landscape use and **make biodiversity conservation part of land-use planning**

## Biodiversity hotspots and protected areas

- Biodiversity hotspots: Regions supporting many **endemic species** (species that live in a single defined geographic location)
    - Used to covered 15.7% of the planet’s land surface
  – But now down to 2.3%, still home to more than **a third of all species**
- Protected areas: set up nature reserve, national parks etc. to protect hotspots

## Zoned reserves

- Zoned Reserve:
  – Protected core: **undisturbed areas**.
  – Buffer zone (surrounding protected core): **areas modified for economic use**.
- Setting aside lands is not always enough to ensure effective conservation:
  – External pressures: settlements, hunting, livestock competition, habitat loss.
  – Seasonal wildlife movement in and out of parks.
- Key challenge:
  – Develop a compatible social and economic climate in surrounding lands to ensure the long- term viability of the protected core.
  – Support human activities without harming the core.

## Introduction to Sustainable Use of Land

## Agriculture

- Raising crops and livestock for human use and consumption.
    - **Cropland**: Land for growing crops.
    - **Rangeland**: Land for grazing livestock.
- **Industrial agriculture**: Introduced large-scale mechanization and fossil fuel use.
  – **Increased irrigation, synthetic fertilizers, and chemical pesticides**.
  – **More monocultures**: vast areas of single crops in orderly rows.
- **Sustainable agriculture** maintains healthy soil, clean water, pollinators, and other vital resources.
  – The overall approach is to **mimic** the way **natural ecosystems** function.
  – Low-input agriculture is an approach that uses less amounts of fossil fuels, water, pesticides, fertilizers, growth hormones, and antibiotics than are used in industrial agriculture.
- Achieving sustainable agriculture requires an **understanding of the water, nutrients, soil and pollinators that underpin agriculture**.
- Irrigation:
    - Largest use of water by humans: 70% of all freshwater withdrawals.
    - Plants use only about 40% of the water
- Water Conservation:
    - Switching to drip irrigation can reduce water use.
    - Matching crops to the local climate is an effective way to conserve water.
- Nutrition:
    - In industrial agriculture, overapplication of inorganic fertilizers has impacts beyond the farm field, because nutrients not taken up by plants end up elsewhere.
    - Compounds such as nitrogen oxides may **pollute the air**.
    - Nitrates can **leach** into aquifers and contaminate drinking water.
    - Run-off of phosphates and nitrogen compounds can alter the ecology of waterways by causing **algae bloom**.
    - Switching to organic fertilisers (remains or wastes of organisms) can provide nutrients, enhance nutrient retention, improve soil structure and increase water-retaining capacity.
    - Sustainable fertiliser use:
        - Integrate organic and inorganic fertilizers
        - Precision Agriculture: Use technology to monitor crop conditions and needs
            - Maximize production while minimizing resource waste
            - Avoid overapplication of fertilizer
        - Example:
            - Drip irrigation systems can add fertilizer to irrigation water
            - Release fertilizer only above plant roots and only when needed

## Livestock

- **Animal agriculture** accounts for 14.5% of our **greenhouse gas emissions**
- Feedlots
    - Also known as factory farms or concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).
    - Huge pens designed to deliver energy-rich food to animals at high densities
    - Current Statistics: Nearly half the world’s pork and most of its poultry come from feedlots.
    - Efficiency:
        - Optimize feeding and resource allocation.
        - Enhance cattle health and growth for higher yields.
    - Pros:
        - Economic efficiency and greater food production, and this makes animal products affordable to more people.
        - Reduces grazing impacts across large areas of the landscape
    - Cons:
        - Livestock produce prodigious amounts of manure and urine, and bacterial which can cause pollution and infection.
        - The crowded conditions under which animals are kept in feedlots necessitate heavy use of antibiotics to control disease, leading to antibiotic resistance.
        - Hormones are administered to livestock to spur growth.

## Technologies towards sustainable use of land

## Urban Farming

- **Vertical farming**: cultivation of crops in vertically stacked layers in cities & urban areas.
    - Conditions can be controlled to grow different types of crops.
    - Employ a combination of recycled water, air-temperature and humidity control, solar panel lighting or controlled 24 h LED lighting to minimize seasonaliy and reduce cost of production
    - Can be indoor (conditions can be easily controlled, reduces cost of production) or outdoor
- Either soil-based or hydroponic
    - Hydroponic farming: plants are grown under **soilless conditions** with **nutrients fed through a solution that flow past the plant roots**.
- Closed-loop systems
    - water is recycled - 90% less water usage
    - Precise control over nutrient delivery
    - minimizes pest and disease pressure

## Cultivated Meat

- Production of meat through in-vitro cultivation of animal cells, rather than slaughtering of animals.
- Steps:

1. A biopsy is first taken from a live animal.
2. Stem cells are then obtained by cutting the muscles. These stem cells have the ability to not only proliferate, but can also transform themselves into other types of cells such as muscle and fat cells.
3. The stem cells are grown in culture medium, typically containing fetal bovine serum (FBS). As the cells proliferate, they would form myotubes which can then grow into muscle tissues

## Genetic Engineering Creates GMO

- Genetic engineering: a process whereby scientists directly manipulate an organism’s genetic material in the lab by adding, deleting, or changing segments of DNA
- Genetically modified foods: foods derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), organisms that are genetically engineered.
- Genetic engineering uses **recombinant DNA** (DNA patched together from the DNA of multiple organisms).
- Goal: to **introduce genes** that produce certain proteins and/or code for certain desirable characters (**such as rapid growth, disease resistance, or high nutritional content**) **into the genomes** of organisms lacking those characters.

## DNA

- Polymer made of 4 types of monomers (A, T, G, C) called nucleotides
- Gene is a **short segment of DNA** (DNA=deoxyribonucleic acid) located in a chromosome
- DNA is composed of **2 chains** held together by hydrogen bond.
- Both chain store the **same genetic information (sequence complementary)**
- The information is **read from 5’ (5’ carbon connected to phospate) to 3’ (3’ carbon connected to phospate) end** which is the phosphate free ends of the strand.
- **Gene’s function**: Genes code for **proteins** that perform specific functions
- Genes are inherited from parents. Organisms from the **same species have same sets of genes**.
- However, the exact sequences in each gene may differ, which cause **genetic variations among the same species**
- DNA is composed of 2 polymer chains hold up together by hydrogen bond.
– Sequence in two chains complementary:
    - **A-T: 2 hydrogen bonds**
    - **G-C: 3 hydrogen bonds**
– Two chains are antiparallel, i.e., run in opposite directions (phosphate group represents 5’ end)
- Both chain store the same genetic information (sequence complementary), so we often only write 1 chain from 5’ to 3’ end.
- Unit for size of DNA: base pair (bp) (one pair of DNA) or kilo base pair (kb)

## Recombinant DNA

- Genetic engineering uses **recombinant DNA** i.e., DNA molecule patched together from DNA segments of different organisms
- Bacteria, e.g., **E.coli**, is often used to create recombinant DNA

## Journey of Food From Farm to Fork

- **Food miles** contributes significantly to the “transport” stage in a LCA study.
- By reducing food miles, we can reduce time, manpower, transportation (land, sea, air) fuel, resources for logistics, etc.
- Food is obtained fresh and will have longer shelf life for the consumer.
