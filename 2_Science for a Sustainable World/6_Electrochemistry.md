- **Reducing** the p**roduction of waste CO₂** (**decarbonization**) entering the atmosphere
- **Increasing CO₂ removal** from the atmosphere

## Electrochemistry

- Study of chemical processes that cause electrons ($e^–$) to move
- Movement of electrons from one element to another to generate electricity
- Redox reactions: oxidation and reduction reactions
    - **Oxidation**: electron **donating**
    - **Reduction**: electron **accepting**

### Oxidation numbers

| The Oxidation State of... | Summary | Examples |
|---------------------------|---------|----------|
| An atom in an element is zero | Element: 0 | Na(s), O₂(g), O₃(g), Hg(l) |
| A monatomic ion is the same as its charge | Monatomic ion: charge of ion | Na⁺, Cl⁻ |
| Fluorine is −1 in its compounds | Fluorine: −1 | HF, PF₃ |
| Oxygen is usually −2 in its compounds **Exception:** peroxides (containing O₂²⁻), in which oxygen is −1 | Oxygen: −2 | H₂O, CO₂ |
| Hydrogen is +1 in its covalent compounds | Hydrogen: +1 | H₂O, HCl, NH₃ |

### Balancing Redox Reactions

1. Divide the skeleton reaction into two half reactions: oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
2. Balance all atoms except O, and H.
3. Balance O atoms by adding H2O to one side of the reaction.
4. Balance H atoms by adding H+ ions to one side of the reaction.
5. Balance charge by adding electrons (e-) to the left side in the reduction half- reaction and to the right side in the oxidation half-reaction.
6. Multiply each half-reaction by a factor such that when the half-reactions are added, the electrons cancel.
7. Add the two half reactions and cancel compounds that appear both as reactants and products. Check the atoms are balanced.
8. If under basic conditions, add the appropriate number of OH- to balance the H+ to both side of the reaction. Simplify the equation by noting that H+ reacts with OH- to give H2O and cancel the excess of H2O.

*Example: (Acidic environment)*
Cr₂O₇²⁻ (aq) + Fe²⁺ (aq) ⇄ Cr³⁺ (aq) + Fe³⁺ (aq)

1. Split into half-reactions:
    - Reduction: Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) ⇄ Cr³⁺(aq)
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ Fe³⁺(aq)
2. Balance everything except H and O
    - Reduction: Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq)
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺ (aq) ⇄ Fe³⁺(aq)
3. Balance O by adding H₂O
    - Reduction: Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) ⇄ 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O(aq)
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ Fe³⁺(aq)
4. Balance H by adding H⁺
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ Fe³⁺(aq)
    - Reduction: 14H⁺(aq) + Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq) + 7H₂O(aq)
5. Balance charge by adding electrons
    - Reduction: 14H⁺(aq) + Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) + 6e⁻ ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq) + 7H₂O (aq)
    - Oxidation: Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ Fe³⁺(aq) + e⁻
6. Balance between the two reactions
    - Reduction: 14H⁺(aq) + Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) + 6e⁻ ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq) + 7H₂O (aq)
    - Oxidation: 6Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ 6Fe³⁺(aq) + 6e⁻
7. Add the two half reactions and cancel out common compounds
    - 14H⁺(aq) + Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) + 6Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq) + 7H₂O (aq) + 6Fe³⁺(aq)

If this reaction happened in a **basic** environment,

Add hydroxide to both sides: 14H²O(l) + Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) + 6Fe²⁺(aq) ⇄ 2Cr³⁺(aq) + 7H₂O (aq) + 6Fe³⁺(aq) + **14OH⁻(aq)**

### Harvesting Electrochemical Energy

- **Electrons** flow from **oxidation** reaction to **reduction** reaction.
- To harvest the electrochemical energy as the electrons flow, the two reactions (oxidation and reduction) are **connected via an external circuit**.
- The two reactions/cells are **physically separated**.
- **Anode: oxidation reaction**
- **Cathode: reduction reaction**

## Electrochemical Cells

- **Electrode**: plate where the redox reactions happen.

### Galvanic cells (Voltaic cell)

- Energy is released from spontaneous flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode
- System (chemical cell) **does work on surrounding**s (Load)
- **Converts chemcical energy to electrical energy**
- e.g. Batteries, fuel cells
- **Oxidation** reaction: electrons **leave** wire
- **Reduction** reaction: electrons **enter** wire

### Electrolytic cells

- Energy is absorbed to drive non-spontaneous reaction driven by electric current
- Surroundings (power supply) **do work on system** (chemical cell)
- **Converts electrical energy to chemical energy**
- e.g. Rechargeable battery, electroplating

## Salt Bridge

- Tube of non-reacting ions (e.g. $Na^+$ and $SO_4^{2-}$) dissolved in a gel connecting the two half-cells
- Allows the flow of ions to maintain charge balance
- **Cations** move towards the **reduction** half-cell
- **Anions** move towards the **oxidation** half-cell

## Galvanic Cell Notation rules

- The cell terminal is written on the outside: **left for the anode and right for the cathode.**  
- Phase boundaries are shown with a single vertical bar, **|**.  
- For example, at the cathode, the reduction of Cu²⁺(aq) to Cu(s) is shown as:  
  **Cu²⁺(aq) | Cu(s)**  
- Between the anode and cathode, the salt bridge is represented by two vertical bars, **||**.  
  The complete notation for the reaction is:  
  **Zn(s) | Zn²⁺(aq) || Cu²⁺(aq) | Cu(s)**  
- When the half-reaction involves a gas, the electrode is an inert material such as platinum, **Pt**.  
  It is included as a third substance in the half-cell:  
  **Cl₂(g) | Cl⁻(aq) | Pt(s)**
- Shorthand:
  **Anode || Cathode**

## Cell Potential, $E_{cell}^0$

- Measure of the driving force of the electrochemical cell reaction.
- Composed of:
    - **Oxidation** potential for the oxidation half-reaction at the **anode**
        - Larger **negative** potential indicates the element is oxidised easier (stronger reducing agent)
    - **Reduction** potential for the reduction half-reaction at the **cathode**
        - Larger **positive** potential indicates the element is reduced easier (stronger oxidising agent)

$$
E_{cell}^0=E_{cathode}^{o,red}-E_{anode}^{o,red}
$$

- $\Delta E_{cell}^0>0$: spontaneous
- $\Delta E_{cell}^0<0$: non-spontaneous

### Standard Hydrogen Electrode (S.H.E)

- The reaction of H+ to Hz under standard conditions is taken as the reference half-cell.
    - Assigned a potential of 0.00 V
    - Standard Hydrogen Electrode (S.H.E): $2H^+(aq) + 2e^- ⇄ H2(g)$, $E^0 = 0.00V$

## Standard Electrode Potential

- Electrode Potential when:
    - concentrations of solutes are 1 M (=1 mol/l)
    - gas pressures are 1 atm
    - temperature has a specified value (usually 25°C but not always)
    - The superscript degree sign (°) signifies standard state conditions
    - S.H.E is the reference electrode assigned as 0.0 V
- If the anode is at S.H.E, $E_{cathode}^0 = E_{cell}^0$

## Nernst Equation

Under **non-standard conditions**, the Nernst equation predicts **cell potentials** from **standard cell potential** in real-world scenarios where concentrations are not at 1 M and/or pressure not at 1 atm.
$$
-RT\ln K=-nFE_{cell}^0\\
\ln K=\frac{nF}{RT}E_{cell}^0
$$

- Where
    - $E_{\text{cell}}$ = cell potential under non-standard conditions (V)
    - $E^o_{\text{cell}}$ = standard cell potential (V)
    - Faraday constant ($F$) = $96,485\, C mol^{-1}$
    - Gas constant ($R$) = $8.314\, J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$
    - $n$ = number of moles of transferred electrons
    - $T$ = temperature in Kelvin (K)
    - $Q$ = reaction quotient

$$
E_{cell}=E_{cell}^0-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q
$$
