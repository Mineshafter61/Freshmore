# W6 - Electrochemistry

- **Net Zero**: the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced out by their removal from the atmosphere
  - Reducing the production of waste CO<sub>2</sub> (decarbonization) entering the atmosphere
  - Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> removal from the atmosphere

## Electrochemistry

- Study of chemical processes that cause electrons ($e^â€“$) to move
- Movement of electrons from one element to another to generate electricity
- Redox reactions
  - **Oxidation**: electron **donating**
  - **Reduction**: electron **accepting**

### Balancing Redox Reactions

1. Divide the skeleton reaction into two half reactions: oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
2. Balance all atoms except O, and H.
3. Balance O atoms by adding H2O to one side of the reaction.
4. Balance H atoms by adding H+ ions to one side of the reaction.
5. Balance charge by adding electrons (e-) to the left side in the reduction half- reaction and to the right side in the oxidation half-reaction.
6. Multiply each half-reaction by a factor such that when the half-reactions are added, the electrons cancel.
7. Add the two half reactions and cancel compounds that appear both as reactants and products. Check the atoms are balanced.
8. If under basic conditions, add the appropriate number of OH- to balance the H+ to both side of the reaction. Simplify the equation by noting that H+ reacts with OH- to give H2O and cancel the excess of H2O.

### Harvesting Electrochemical Energy

- Electrons flow from oxidation reaction to reduction reaction.
- To harvest the electrochemical energy as the electrons flow, the two reactions (oxidation and reduction) are connected via an external circuit.
- The two reactions/cells are physically separated.

## Electrochemical Cells

### Galvanic cells (Voltaic cell)

- Energy is released from spontaneous flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode
- System (chemical cell) does work on surroundings (Load)
- e.g. Batteries, fuel cells

### Electrolytic cells

- Energy is absorbed to drive non-spontaneous reaction driven by electric current
- Surroundings (power supply) do work on system (chemical cell)
- e.g. Rechargeable battery, electroplating
