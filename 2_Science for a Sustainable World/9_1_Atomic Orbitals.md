# 9_1_Atomic Orbitals

- Maximum number of electrons in shell $n$ is $2n^2$.
- An electron can have only certain energy values, also known as energy levels
- Energy levels are **quantized**
    - Electrons can only exist at certain **discrete** energy levels, rather than any value within a range
    - At $n = 1$, the electron in the atom is in its lowest energy state, called the ground state
    - At $n > 1$, the electron in the atom is in an excited state

- An electron can change energy levels by
    - absorbing energy to move to a higher energy level
    - emitting energy to move to a lower energy level
- The energy absorbed or emitted is usually in the form of photons
- **Light of smaller wavelength (higher frequency) is emitted at higher energy levels**
- The change in energy state, where
    - $h$ = Planck's constant
    - $\nu$ = frequency
    - $\lambda$ = wavelength
    - $c$ = speed of light

$$
|\Delta E|=|E_{\text{final}}-E_{\text{initial}}| \\
|\Delta E|=h\nu={\frac{hc}{\lambda}}
$$

## Binding Energy (BE)

- BE is the energy that holds the electrons to the nucleus
    - It represents the strength of the attraction between the electron and the nucleus
    - The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the higher its binding energy due to the stronger attraction
    - Formula equal but opposite to **ionisation energy**.

$$
E_{n}={\frac{-Z^{2}e^{4}m_{e}}{8\varepsilon_{o}n^{2}h^{2}}}=−(2.18 × 10^{−18}) \frac{Z^2}{n^2}
$$

- $Z$: atomic number
- $Z_{eff}$: effective atomic number
- $m_e$: mass of electrons
- $\epsilon_0$: permittivity of free space
- $h$: Planck's constant
- $n$: energy level
- $e$: charge of single electron, $1.602\times 10^{^-19} C$

- **Change in binding energy**
$$\Delta E_n=−(2.18 × 10^{−18}) Z^2(\frac{1}{n^2_f}-\frac{1}{n^2_i})$$

## Energy Transition between Orbitals

- Moving from initial energy level $n_i$ to final energy level $n_f$,

$$
E_{n_{i}\to n_{f}}=-(2.18\ \times\,10^{-18})(Z^{2})\left(\frac{1}{n_{f}^{2}}-\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}}\right)
$$

- Generalising, where Rydberg constant (for **Hydrogen**), $R = 1.0968×10^7 m^{-1}$, we get

$$
{\text{Wave number}},{\tilde{v}}=\ \frac{1}{\lambda}=R\ \left|\left(\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}}-\ \frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}\right)\right|
$$

## Absorption & Emission Spectrums

- Every element has a unique spectrum based on electrons changing energy levels

## Describing an Orbital using Quantum Numbers

### Angular Momentum Number ($l$)

- Shape of the orbital
- 0: spherical
- 1: two bulbs
- 2: four bulbs
- 3: more bulbs and so on

### Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)

- $-l≤m_l≤l$ (integers)
- *Example*: $l=1; m_l=-1,0,1$ ($l=1$ can follow 3 orientations, x, y, z)
- *Example*: $l=2; m_l=-2,-1,0,1,2$ ($l=2$ can follow 5 orientations)
