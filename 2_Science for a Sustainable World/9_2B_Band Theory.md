# 9_2B_Band Theory

## Molecular Orbital Formation
- Many atomic orbitals (AOs) from various atoms combine to form multiple molecular orbitals (MOs), both stable and unstable.
- These MOs form a continuum of energy levels.
- **Visual Aid:** Draw a block diagram to illustrate bonding and antibonding orbitals forming this continuum.

## Semiconductors
- **Conduction Band (CB):** Electrons in the antibonding state are not involved in bonding and are free to move, allowing electrical conductivity.
- **Valence Band (VB):** Electrons that are involved in bonding and are not free to move.
- **Band Gap (Eg):** The energy gap between the CB and VB.
- **Electron Excitation:** 
  - When an electron absorbs energy, it can jump from the VB to the CB.
  - The size of the band gap determines the wavelength of light required for this transition.

## Band Gap and Periodic Trends
- **Smaller atoms** form **stronger bonds**, resulting in a **larger band gap (Eg)** between the valence and conduction bands.
- **As Î”EN (electronegativity difference) increases**, bonding becomes more **ionic-like**, making the electrons more **localized** and **less mobile**, which **increases the band gap**.

## Energy Band Diagrams
### **Metals**
- **No band gap.**
- At room temperature, electrons have already moved to the conduction band.
- **Result:** High electrical conductivity.

### **Semiconductors**
- **Small band gap.**
- **Heating effect:** Some electrons gain energy and move to the conduction band.
- **Result:** Moderate conductivity.

### **Insulators**
- **Large band gap** prevents electrons from reaching the conduction band.
- Electrons remain in the valence band.
- **No conductivity**, even when heated.

## Temperature Effect on Conductivity
### **Metals**
- **Resistance increases as temperature rises**, leading to lower conductivity.
- At lower temperatures, most electrons are already in the conduction band.
- **Why does conductivity decrease?**
  - Lattice atoms vibrate more at higher temperatures.
  - Electrons scatter more, reducing their ability to conduct electricity.

### **Semiconductors**
- At room temperature, some electrons are already in the conduction band.
- **As temperature increases:**
  - More electrons are excited to the conduction band.
  - Lattice vibrations still occur, causing electron scattering.
- **Net effect:** Conductivity **increases exponentially** due to the growing number of free electrons.
