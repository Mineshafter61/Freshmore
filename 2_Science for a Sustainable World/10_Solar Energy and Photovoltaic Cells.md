# 10_Solar Energy and Photovoltaic Cells

- When energy equal to the energy level of the conduction band is absorbed by an electron, it can be freed, leaving a hole behind.
  - A hole is an empty electron spot in the positive charge
  - It can move around freely
  - It is also free to conduct electricity
- At $T = 0K$, all electrons are occupied in covalent bonds and are not free to move in the lattice structure (conduct)
- At $T > 0K$, thermal energy can create few electron-hole **pairs** resulting in weak conduction

## Intrinsic & Compound Semiconductors

- Pure or intrinsic semiconductors: made of a single pure semiconductor material.
  - e.g. B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, As, Te, Po.
- Compound semiconductors: comprised of more than 2 semiconductor materials.
  - e.g. GaAs & InSb (III-V), CdS & ZnTe (II-VI)
- A larger electronegativity difference between elements results in wider energy gap. (different combinations of elements produce different band gaps)

## Photovoltaic (PV) or Solar Cells

- When sunlight hits the solar panel, electrons are knocked loose from some of the silicon atoms leaving behind a hole
- The electrons are free to move based on the $+$ and $–$ terminals present in the solar panel (FYI: p-n junction)
- Connecting the two plates with wires enables the electrons to flow back to the original plate, creating an electrical **DC current**, which can be converted into alternating (AC) current
- Only photons with **energy larger than the bandgap** of the semiconductor will be absorbed to excite electrons to the conduction band
  - **One** absorbed photon will generate **one** pair of electron and hole (electron-hole pair), no adding halves
- Recall,

$$
E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
1\, eV = 1.602 \cdot 10^{–19}\, J
$$

### Efficiency of PV Cells

- Quantum efficiency $\eta_{EQE}$ is the percentage of photons converted to electric current under short circuit conditions

$$
\eta_{EQE} = \frac{\text{\# of elecrons generated in flowing circuit per s}}{\text{\# of indicdent photons per s (photon flux)}}
$$

### Generation and Recombination

- **Generation**
  - Electrons that get excited into the conduction band leave a hole in the valence band.
  - Generates pairs of electrons and holes. Electron gains energy either by thermal energy (lattice vibration), applied voltage, or light (photons).
- **Recombination**
  - Electrons in the conduction band go down in energy to occupy a vacant site in the valence band, i.e. electron recombines with a hole.
  - Electron loses its energy in the form of light, or thermal energy, i.e. photons, and phonons (lattice vibrations)

## Types of PV Cells

1. **Monocrystalline** - Silicon-based, highly efficient but more expensive
2. **Polycrystalline** - Silicon-based, less efficient alternative, dominates the world market; cheaper than monocrystalline
3. **Thin film** - Silicon-based, much more flexible and durable but lower efficiency; cheapest

- Higher efficiency PV technologies such as those including gallium arsenide and
multi-junction cells, less common due to their high cost
- Lifespan of 25 years, installations pay for themselves within 10 years
