# 9_2A_Molecular Orbital Theory

## Electrons

- Exhibit **wave-particle duality**
    - Property in which objects behave as a wave or a particle depending on the situation.
- Found in discrete energy levels (n)
- Found in 3D space
- Quantum model: **electron cloud**

## Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory

- **Qualitatively** describes bonding in molecules.
- Fits the experimentally measured binding energies for electrons in molecules.

### Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)

- **Mathematically combine atomic wave functions (AOs)** of **nearby atoms** to form **molecular wave functions (MOs)**.
- **Bonding MO**: **addition** of wave function (constructive interference)
- **Antibonding MO**: **subtraction** of wave function (destructive interference)

### Constructive interference

- Happens when **two AOs are in phase**
- **Helps in bonding**
- 2 atoms can be together
- Molecular orbital has **σ symmetry**

### Destructive interference

- Haooens when **two AOs are not in phase**
- Does not help in bonding; causes **antibonding** instead
- Creates a **node**, a point in which no electron presence is found
- Region around node is dominated by repulsion between nuclei

## Molecular Orbital Energy Diagram

Consists of:

1. **Energy** axis (vertical)
2. Atomic orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p, etc), drawn on the left and right of the diagram.
3. Molecular orbitals, drawn in the middle of the diagram.
    - Bonding MO (e.g. $\sigma_{1s}$)
    - Anti-bonding MO (e.g. $\sigma^*_{1s}$)
    - Molecular **bonding orbitals** (e.g. $\sigma_{1s}$) are always **lower in energy** (i.e. drawn **lower**) than the atomic orbitals that they were formed from
    - **Anti-bonding orbitals** (e.g. $\sigma^*_{1s}$) are always **higher in energy** (i.e. drawn **higher**) than the atomic orbitals that they came from
    - Note: $^*$ to denote anti-bonding; $\sigma$ for **cylindrically symmetrical**
4. Electrons of molecule (drawn as **arrows**, first **spread out among orbitals**, then **clustered with one arrow pointing down and one arrow pointing up**)

### Period 1 (n = 1)

### Period 2 (n=2)

- MOs formed from 2p orbitals have higher energy than MOs formed from 2s orbitals
- Bonding MOs are lower in energy than anti-bonding MOs, i.e.

$$
\sigma_{2p}<\sigma^*_{2p}\text{ and }\pi_{2p}<\pi^*_{2p}
$$

- AOs with similar energy will interact to form MOs
- **For atomic number (Z) ≥ 8**

- **For atomic number (Z) ≤ 7**

## MO Bond Order

$$
\text{Bond Order}=\frac{1}{2}[(\text{number of electrons in bonding MO})-(\text{number of electrons in antibonding MO})]
$$

- Bond order > 0: **molecule more stable** than separate atoms, therefore **molecule forms**
- Bond order > 0: **molecule is as stable** as separate atoms, therefore **molecule will not form**
- A **higher bond order** means a **larger bond strength**.

## Magnetic Properties

- Electron spin generates a tiny magnetic field
- **Paramagnetic** species:
    - Contains one or more unpaired electrons
    - Split by an external magnetic field
    - Contains **one or more unpaired electrons (only one arrow)**
- **Diamagnetic**:
    - No unpaired electrons (all fields have 2 arrows)
    - Not affected by an external magnetic field

## HOMO & LUMO

- HOMO
    - **Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital**
    - Orbital that can act as an **electron donor**.
- LUMO
    - **Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital**
    - Orbital that can act as an **electron acceptor**.
- Symmetry of HOMO or LUMO is **σ** or **π**
- If **HOMO and LUMO are the same**, the symmetry is **π**.
