## Netwon's laws

### First law of motion
- All objects with mass continues to **move at constant velocity** unless there is a net physical force acting on the object.
- Not all reference frames observe Newton's first law.
	- If Newton's first law is valid in a reference frame, it is called the **inertial frame of reference**.
### Second law of motion
- Equation: $\vec{F} \equiv m\vec{a}$ or $\vec{F}=\frac{d(m \vec{v})}{dt}$
### Third law of motion
- Equation = $\vec{F_{12}}= - \vec{F_{21}}$
- When two bodies interact, they will be in an action-reaction pair
## Common forces
- Gravitational force
	- Magnitude of the force is $\vec{F_{12}}= - \vec{F_{21}}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$ where G is the universal gravitational constant of $6.67 * 10^-11 Nm^2 kg^{-2}$
- Contact force
	- Normal force $\vec{N}$: **perpendicular** to the surface
	- Friction surface $\vec{f}$: **parallel** to the surface that **opposes relative motion**.
		- Comes in two types: static $\vec{f_{s}}$ when not moving, and kinetic $\vec{f_{k}}$ when moving.
		- $\vec{f} = \mu \vec{N}$ where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction. (for both types)
- Spring force: force exerted by spring tends to restore to the equilibrium position.
	- Hooke's law: $F = -k \Delta l$ where k is the spring constant and $\Delta l$ is the displacement from equilibrium.
- Tension: pulling force transmitted along the length of a string, rope, cable, chain or rod.
- Always acts on the object **by the rope**
	- Points towards midpoint of rope
## Free body diagram
- Isolate each body as point masses
- Calculate the forces acting on each body independently.
- Steps to solve:
	1. Treat each object in the system like a point mass.
	2. Identify the physical forces acting on the object(s) of interest. Only physical forces (those obey Newton’s 3rd law) that arise from the interaction between physical bodies are included (we adopt inertial frame of reference).
	3. Draw free body diagram(s) of the object(s). Label all physical force vectors clearly.
	4. Choose an appropriate coordinate system and express the force and acceleration vectors properly (in terms of unit vectors of the coordinate). You may have to decompose the forces or accelerations along each of the axes.
	5. In each unit vector direction, write down Newton’s 2nd law of motion to relate the dynamic cause (physical forces) to the kinematic effect (acceleration), i.e. $$\sum^n_{i=1} \vec{F_{i}} = m\vec{a}$$
	6. Look for any constraint conditions that limit the degree of freedom of the motions, e.g. the 2 objects must accelerate together, the string tie to the object is inextensible, the object keeps a constant distant from the pole, and etc.
## Friction
Reducing friction:
1. Lubricants
	- Fills up gaps and smoothes surfaces.
2. Wheels
	- Kinetic friction reduced by $\frac{\text{radius of the axle}}{\text{radius of wheel}}$.

- Fluid resistance on a body depends on the speed of the body, typically $Dv^2$, where $D$ is the coefficient depending on the density of the fluid and area and shape of the body.
- Falling body reaches its terminal velocity when upwards force $f = mg$
### Properties of ideal ropes and pulleys
- Ideal Rope
	- Massless
	- Tension is the **same** at any point of the string ($\vec{T}$)
- Ideal Pulley
	- Frictionless
	- Transfers the **same magnitude** of force in any direction
