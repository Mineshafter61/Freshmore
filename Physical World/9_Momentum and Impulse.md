## Momentum
- State of a system: **position** and **momentum** (both are fundamental)
- Momentum $\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$
- Can be represented as the product of mass and velocity
- Measures the quantity of the motion that obeys the conservation law
- Net force = time range of change of momentum
- $\vec{F}_{net}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=\frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt}=\left( \frac{dm}{dt}\vec{v}+m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \right)$
- Average force = $\vec{F}_{ave}=\frac{\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \vec{F} \, dt}{t_f-t_0}$
## Impulse
- Impulse = $\vec{I}=\int_{t_f}^{t_0} \vec{F} \, dt=\vec{F}_{ave}\cdot(t_f-t_0)$
- Area under curve of force-time graph (ref. [[8_Energy and Work Done#Work Done]])
- Impulse results in the **change** in momentum $\Delta \vec{p}$
	- It is **not** momentum
## Momentum, Kinetic Energy and Work Done
- Kinetic energy and momentum are related by:
- $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=\frac{m^{2}v^{2}}{2m}=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}$
- Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem in terms of momentum:
- $W=\int_{\vec{r_{t_0}}}^{\vec{r_{t_f}}} \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}=\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2=\frac{p_f^2}{2m}-\frac{p_0^2}{2m}$
- $\Delta K \neq \frac{|\Delta \vec{p}|^2}{2m}$
- Work‚ÄêKinetic Energy theorem states that work done by a force is the change of kinetic energy of the system (**scalar**)
- Impulse is the change in momentum of a system (**vector**)
- Change in KE is **not** impulse since there is **direction** associated with impulse
## Internal forces
- All internal forces arise from a collection of objects interacting with each other.
- Sum of all internal forces is zero.
## Conservation of momentum
- The momentum of a system is conserved ($\Delta \vec{p}_{sys} = 0$) **if and only if**
	- the external force is 0 (in the direction of calculation); or
	- the interaction time with external forces is negligible
