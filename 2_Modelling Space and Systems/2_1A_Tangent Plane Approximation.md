## Tangent plane
- The tangent plane to a surface at a point is a plane that “best approximates” the surface near the point
- Equation of a tangent plane to a surface $z=f(x,y)$ at a point $P=(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0)): $$z=f(x_0,y_0)+f_x(x_0,y_0)(x−x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y−y_0)$$
- The equation can also be written as $$z-z_0=f_x(x_0,y_0)(x−x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y−y_0)$$
## Tangent Plane Approximation
- The tangent plane is very close to the surface near the point of contact
- We can approximate the surface value near the point by using the value of the plane near that point
- The tangent plane approximation to a differentiable function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ near the point $(x_0,y_0)$ is given by (same as above): $$f(x,y)≈f(x_0,y_0)+f_x(x_0,y_0)(x−x_0)+f_y(x_0,y0_)(y−y0)$$, i.e. we approximate $f(x,y)$ by the $z$-value of the tangent plane.
