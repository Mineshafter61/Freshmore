# Multivariable Functions

- A function $f$ of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ in a set $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x,y)$. The set $D$ is the domain of $f$ and its range is the set of values that $f$ takes on.
- Notation: $z=f(x,y)$
  - $z$ is a function of $x$ and $y$.
  - $x$ and $y$ are the independent variables.
  - $z$ is the dependent variable.

## Graphs

- A function of two variables has a graph of a **surface** in 3D space.
- Remember to convince the examiner that the graph is the graph you are sketching before sketching it.
  - If it has a linear slope, show that the linear slope exists
