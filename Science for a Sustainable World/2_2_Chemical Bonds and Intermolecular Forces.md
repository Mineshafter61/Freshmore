## Molecules
- Atoms bond with each other to form a resultant molecule which has **lower energy** and is **more stable**
	- This is done through achieving the **Octet rule** or having **8 valence electrons**
- Chemical bond is attraction between atoms
## Types of bonds
### Metallic bond
- Electrons can be shared with **all metallic atoms** in a material
	- **Attraction between metal "cations" & "sea" of valence electrons**
- Elements lose outer electrons easily (low IE, well shielded)
- Contribute their valence electrons to form delocalized electron "sea"
- Valence electrons shared amongst many other atoms
- Good electric & heat conductor, Malleable, High melting point
### Ionic bond
- Electrons can be **transferred** from from a **metal atom** to a **non-metal atom**
	- **Electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions**
- **Metals** with **low IE** lose one or more valence electrons to form a **cation**
- **Non-metals** with **high EA** gain one or more electrons to form an **anion**
### Covalent bond
- Electrons can be shared between **neighbouring atoms**
- Greater electron density between the nuclei of two atoms
- There can be equal or unequal sharing of electrons
- Difference in **electronegativity** dictates the "equality" of electron sharing
## Measure of Bond Polarity
1. Difference in EN

| $\Delta$ EN | Bond							 |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 0					 | Non-polar covalent |
| 0.1 - 0.4	 | Covalent					 |
| >0.4 - 1.7	| Polar covalent		 |
| >1.7 - 3.3	| Ionic							|

2. Percent of Ionic character, $\delta$
	- Arbitrary cutoff at $\delta=50\%$
## Bond Properties
- **Bond order**: Number of electron pairs (bonds) being shared between a given pair of atoms
- **Bond energy**: Energy required to overcome attraction between the nuclei and shared electrons
- **Bond length** Distance between nuclei of the bonded atoms in the molecule
- A **higher bond order** results in a **shorter bond length** and **higher bond energy**
## Intermolecular Interaction
| Species A							 | Species B							 | Strongest Possible<br>Interaction |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ion										 | Ion										 | Ion-ion													 |
| Ion										 | Atom/non-polar molecule | Ion-induced dipole								|
| Ion										 | Polar molecule					| Ion-dipole												|
| Polar molecule					| Polar molecule					| Dipole-dipole										 |
| Polar molecule					| Atom/non-polar molecule | Dipole-induced dipole						 |
| Atom/non-polar molecule | Atom/non-polar molecule | London dispersion forces					|

## Ion-dipole interactions
- Polar molecules (dipole) will interact with both cations and anions
- Dipole's negative end will attract to cation and positive end will attract to anion
## Ion-induced dipole interactions
- Electric field from ion can induce a distortion in the electron cloud of an atom or molecule
	- For **non-polar** molecules, this induces a **temporary dipole moment**
	- For **polar** molecules, this field **enhances** existing dipole moment (see ion-dipole interactions above)
- **Polarisability**: Ease in which a particle's electron cloud is distorted
	- **Increases down the group** as atomic size increases, **large** particles are **more polarisable** as their electrons are held less tightly
	- **Decreases across the period** because of increasing $Z_{eff}$
- Cations are smaller than their parent atoms and less polarisable, anions show the opposite trend
## Dipole-dipole interactions
- Interaction (attraction/repulsion) depends on orientation
	- Based on the degree of electronegativity ($\delta^+$ or $\delta^-$)
### Hydrogen bond
- Special type of dipole-dipole interaction
- Molecule must have a **hydrogen atom** **covalently bonded** to a small, electronegative atom with **lone electron pairs**
	- Specifically, $F$, $O$ or $N$
- A lone pair is a pair of valence electrons that are not shared with another atom in a covalent bond
- Intermolecular hydrogen bonds can exist between $H$ atom of 1 molecule and the lone pair of another molecule
	- In $H2O$, 2 of 6 valence electrons used for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the other 2 electron pairs are used for intermolecular hydrogen bonding with other $H2O$ molecules resulting in a tetrahedral arrangement
## Dipole-induced dipole interactions
- Polar molecule induces a dipole in an atom or non-polar molecule by disturbing the arrangement of electrons in the non-polar species
## London dispersion forces (AKA temporary dipole-induced dipole interactions)
- Electrons in atoms or non-polar molecules are distributed symmetrically over time
- At any instance, there may be one molecule with more electrons on one side, creating a temporary dipole
- When another molecule is sufficiently close, this temporary dipole induces a dipole in the other molecule
- Always present, but the weakest type of interaction only effective at short range
- Dispersion forces are **stronger** for **more polarisable** (larger) particles
## Summary of Intermolecular Interactions
- Ionic interactions
	- Ion-dipole: 40-600 kJ/mol
	- Ion-induced dipole: 3-15 kJ/mol
- Dipole interactions
	- Dipole-dipole: 5-25 kJ/mol
	- Hydrogen bond: 10-40 kJ/mol
	- Dipole-induced dipole: 2-10 kJ/mol
- London Dispersion: 0.05-40 kJ/mol
## Physical Properties
- Stronger intermolecular interactions
	- Less molecules with sufficient KE to "break free" from liquid/solid phase by overcoming intermolecular attraction
	- Lower vapor pressure
	- Higher boiling point (BP)
	- **Hydrogen bonds are stronger than dipole-dipole interactions**, hence water has a higher BP
- More elongated shape
	- More points at which dispersion forces act
	- Higher BP
