## Determining the Load Energy Requirement
- Li-ion batteries have higher capacity and DOD, but lead acid batteries do not need BMS and work in a wider range of temperatures (-20 to 50˚C)
- **Battery management system** (BMS) should be used for Li-ion batteries to prevent thermal runaway.
- Optimal temperature for Li-ion batteries are between **10 and 25˚C**.
- Voltage times current times time; $E=IVt$ and $P=IV$
