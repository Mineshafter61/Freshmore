# W5 - Exergy in an Open System
## Second Law (Exergetic) Efficiency, 𝜀
The ratio of actual thermal efficiency to the maximum possible (reversible/ideal) thermal efficiency under the same conditions.
$$
𝜀 = \frac{\eta}{\eta_{rev}}=\frac{COP}{COP_{rev}}=\frac{\text{exergy recovered}}{\text{exergy supplied}}=1-\frac{\text{exergy destroyed}}{\text{exergy supplied}}
$$
- Ranges from a value of 0 to a value of 1.
- For power producing devices, $𝜀 = \frac{W_{out}}{W_{rev,out}}$
- For power consuming devices, $𝜀 = \frac{W_{rev,in}}{W_{in}}$
$${\frac{dX_{system}}{dt}}=\bigl(\dot{X}_{heat,in}-\dot{X}_{heat,out}\bigr)+\bigl(\dot{X}_{work,in}-\dot{X}_{work,out}\bigr)+\sum_{in}\dot{m}\psi-\sum_{out}\dot{m}\psi-\dot{X}_{destroyed}$$
- **Note: For water property table, take $\Delta s$ without the correction term $r \ln\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ as that is for ideal gas**
