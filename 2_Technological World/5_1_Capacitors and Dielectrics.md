## Work Done to Charge Up a Capacitor and Energy Stored in the Electric Field
- Using $\Delta U_E = q \Delta V$ and $\Delta V = \frac{Q}{C}$, the total energy to charge an empty capacitor to q = Q is given by:
$$
W=\int dW=\int dq \Delta V=\frac{1}{C} \int_0^Q q\,dq= \frac{1}{C} \frac{Q^2}{2} \\
\text{Energy stored in capacitor, } U = W = \frac{Q^2}{2C} = \frac{1}{2}C|\Delta V|^2
$$
- **For parallel-plate capacitors only,**
$$
C = \frac{𝜀_0A}{d}, |V| = Ed \\
U = \frac{1}{2}\frac{𝜀_0A}{d}(Ed)^2 = \frac{𝜀_0E^2}{2} \times (Ad) = u_E \times (\text{volume})
$$
- Where electric field energy density,
$$
u_E = \frac{𝜀_0E^2}{2}
$$
## Combining Capacitors (Series)
- Potential difference is **cumulative** in series
  - $\Delta V = \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2$
- Using $\Delta V = \frac{Q}{C}$,
- $C_{eq}=(\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2})^{-1}$
  - Where $C_eq$ is the equivalent capacitance of the network
## Combining Capacitors (Parallel)
- Potential difference across 2 points in parallel is **constant**
  - $\Delta V = \Delta V_1 = \Delta V_2$
- Using $Q = C\Delta V$,
- $Q=Q_1+Q_2=C_1\Delta V+C_2\Delta V=C_{eq}\Delta V$
- $C_{eq}=C_1+C_2$
- Same as resistors in series
## Dielectrics
- Polar dielectrics: dielectrics with permanent electric dipole moments
- Non-polar dielectrics: dielectrics with induced dipole moments
- External electric field induces an electric field in the dielectric material
- Overall field $\vec{E}=\vec{E}_{ext}+\vec{E}_{induced}$
- Induced field only decreases the electric field
## Dielectric constant, $𝜅$
- Weakened electric field due to dielectric:
$$
E=E_0/𝜅
$$
  - where $E_0$ is the original field
- Permittivity of material
$$
𝜀 = 𝜅𝜀_0
$$
## Dielectric in a Capacitor
- Capacitance becomes $𝐶=𝜅𝐶_0$ (increases)
	- $𝐶_0$ is the initial configuration (without dielectric)
- Charge becomes $𝑄=𝜅𝑄_0$
	- $𝑄_0$ is the initial configuration (without dielectric)
	- The extra charge has to be provided by an external source (if there is nothing connected when the dielectric is inserted, the charge remains the same!)
