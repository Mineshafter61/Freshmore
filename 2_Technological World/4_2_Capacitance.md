- Conductor
	- Charges are free to move
	- Electrons are weakly bound to the atoms
- Insulator
	- Charges are not free to move
	- Electrons are strongly bound to atoms
## Capacitor
- Fundamental electrical component with two isolated conductors and an insulator
- Conductors are deposited with equal and opposite charges $\pm Q$
- Used to store charge and electrical energy
- If the potential difference between the two conductors is $\Delta V$, a constant called the capacitance $C$ is defined as the **ability to store charge**, 
$$
C=\frac{Q}{|\Delta V|}=\frac{\varepsilon_0A}{d}
$$
- Units: Coulomb per Volt or Farad (F)
- $C$ is always **Positive**
## Parallel Plate Capacitor
- Simplest form of capacitor
- Usually assumed that the dimensions of the plates are very long as compared to the distance $d$ between the plates.
- Using gaussian surfaces, between the 2 plates
$$
E = 2 \cdot \frac{\rho}{2\varepsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{A\varepsilon_0}
$$
- Thus, potential difference between the 2 plates can be derived
$$
\Delta V = - \int^{\text{top}}_{\text{bottom}} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{s} = Ed = \frac{Q}{A\varepsilon_0}d
$$
- Therefore, capacitance is
$$
C = \frac{Q}{|\Delta V|} = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
$$
- Capacitance $C$ is only dependent on **geometric factors**
	- In this case, $A$ and $d$ for a parallel plate capacitor
	- $\varepsilon_0$ can be a different value with the use of **electrolytic capacitors**
		- Insulators (dielectrics) between the 2 plates instead of vacuum
### When disconnected from a battery
- We increase the separation distance $d$
- Charge $Q$ remains constant regardless of $d$
- As $d$ increases, $V = Ed$ increases
### When connected to a battery
- We increase the separation distance $d$
- Potential $V$ between the plates is constant (potential difference of battery)
- By $V = Ed$, $E \propto Q$, $E$ and $Q$ decreases
