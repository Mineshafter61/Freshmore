## Sets
- Definition: collection of objects
- Notation: {elements...}
- ∪ Union
- ∩ Intersection
- ∅ Empty set

## Functions
- Definition: A rule that assigns each value x in a set D to a unique value denoted f(x) (Set R).
- Independent variable: $x$, described in Domain D.
- Dependent variable: $y$, or $f(x)$, described in Range R.
- Domain: set of all independent values
- Range: is all values produced by the function
- x causes the denominator of function to be 0 ↔︎ function is undefined at x.

## Graph of a function
- Definition: set of all points $(x, y)$ in the xy-plane that satisfy the equation $y=f(x)$
- Graph is a function ↔︎ passes vertical line test
- $D = {x_1, x_2, x_3} \Leftrightarrow R = {f(x_1), f(x_2), f(x_3)}$

## Arguments and Intervals
- Argument: expression on which the function works (x in f(x))
- Intervals: parts of the real line. For numbers a and b:
	- $[a, b] = a ≤ x ≤ b$
	- $(a, b) = a < x < b$
	- $(a, b] = a ≤ x < b$
	- $[a, b) = a ≤ x < b$

## Types of functions
- **Polynomials**: $p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots$ , where n is a non-negative integer
	- Domain: ℝ, or $(-∞, ∞)$
	- **Form**: $f(x) = x^n$, where $n > 0$
	- Function is even when $n$ is an even integer
	- Function is odd when $n$ is an odd integer
- **Rational functions**: $f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where p and q are polynomials
- **Algebraic functions**: constructed using the operations of algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, roots). Even root → domain is nonnegative.
	- Property of $\sqrt{x}$: D, R = $[0, ∞)$
	- **Form**: $f(x) = x^\frac{1}{n}$, where n > 0
	- Even n ⇒ D and R are always nonnegative
	- Odd n ⇒ odd function
- **Exponential function**: $f(x) = b^x$, where b ≠ 1 and b is a positive real number.
	- Natural exponential function is $f(x) = e^x$.
	- Natural logarithm function is $f(x) = \ln(x)$.
- **Trigonometric functions**: $\sin{x}$, $\cos{x}$, $\tan{x}$, $\cot{x}$, $\sec{x}$, $\csc{x}$
- **Piecewise function**: different definitions on different parts of its domain.
	- [Graphing] Hollow dot: function is not defined at this point
	- [Graphing] Solid dot: function is defined at this point
## Properties of functions
- Increasing function: if $x1 < x2$, $f(x1) < f(x2)$
- Composite function $𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 = 𝑓(𝑔(x))$
	- $g$ is the inner function
	- $f$ is the outer function
- **Find domain of composite function**:
	- Simplify the composite function
	- Find Domain of outer function
	- Solve domain of outer function = inner function
	- Domain is the set of domain values that satisfy the above step
## Function symmetry
Symmetry about...
- y-axis: Graph has $(x,y)$ → graph contains $(-x, y)$.
- x-axis: Graph has $(x,y)$ → graph contains $(x ,-y)$.
- origin: Graph has $(x,y)$ → graph contains $(-x,-y)$.
- Graph is symmetric about both X- and Y-axes → graph is symmetric about origin
- Even function: $f(-x) = f(x)$, symmetry about y-axis
- Odd function: $f(-x) = f(x)$, symmetry about origin
## Slopes and lines
- Line through any two points: secant line
- Slope of secant line: $\frac{Δf(x)}{Δx}$, where h is horizontal change
