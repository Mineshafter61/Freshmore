## Increasing/Decreasing Test
- If $f'(x)>0$ on an interval, then $f$ is **increasing** on that interval.
- If $f'(x)<0$ on an interval, then $f$ is **decreasing** on that interval.
## First Derivative Test
- Suppose that c is a critical number of a continuous function $f$.
- If $f'$ changes from **positive to negative** at $c$, then $f$ has a **local maximum** at $c$.
- If $f'$ changes from **negative to positive** at $c$, then $f$ has a **local minimum** at $c$.
- If $f'$ **does not change sign** at $c$, then $f$ has **no local maximum or minimum** at $c$.
## Concavity Test
- If $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all x in I, then **every local minimum of f is a global minimum**. 
- If $f''(x) \leq 0$ for all x in I, then **every local maximum of f is a global maximum**. 
## Inflection point
- Points where the **second derivative changes sign**, i.e. the second derivative is **zero or doesn't exist**.
## Second Derivative Test
- Suppose $f''$ is continuous near $c$.
- If $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)>0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
- If $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)<0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$.
## Mean value theorem
- If $f$ is a differentiable function on the interval $[a, b]$, then there exists a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that
$$
\begin{gather}
f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\\\
\text{or, equivalently,}\\\\
f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)
\end{gather}
$$
- In other words, there exists a slope of the tangent line with the same magnitude as the slope of the [secant line](1_Functions#Slopes and lines) that connects the two end points of a function.
