- $f^{-1}$ exists => $y = f(x)$ -> $x = f^{-1}(y)$
- $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = f(x)$
- Existence of inverse function: horizontal line test
- f has an inverse ↔︎ f is a one-to-one function
	- Checked graphically using both the horizontal and vertical line tests.
	- For some graphs, a restriction in the domain makes the graph one-to-one.
Example:
> $x^2$ is not a one-to-one function
> However, if we restrict its domain to $(-∞, 0]$, its inverse function is $f^{-1}(x) = -\sqrt{x+1}$ 
> Likewise, if we restrict its domain to $[0, ∞)$, its inverse function is $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x+1}$ 
- Functions and their inverse are reflections about the line y=x.
- Domain for $f^{-1}(x)$ is the range for $f(x)$.
- Range for $f^{-1}(x)$ is the domain for $f(x)$.
