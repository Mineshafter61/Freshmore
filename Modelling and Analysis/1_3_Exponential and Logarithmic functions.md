## Exponential function
- Domain for b^x is ℝ.
- Range is $(0, ∞)$.
- If $b > 1$, $b^x$ is increasing.
- If $0 > b > x$, $b^x$ is decreasing.
- As b gets larger, the exponential function grows more rapidly.
- Inverse function of the exponential function: Logarithmic function

## Logarithmic function
- For x > 0, $b^{\log_{b}(x)} = x$
- $\log_{a}(b) = \frac{\log_{x}a}{\log_{x}b}$
- $\log_{n}(\frac{a}{b}) = \log_{n} a - \log_{n} b$
- $\log_{n}(ab) = \log_{n}a + \log_{n}b$
- $\log_{b} x^p = p \log_{b} x$

### Logarithmic scale
- Equidistant marks represnts powers of 10
- Semi-log plot (exponential function): points are (x, $\log(y)$). Logarithms of base 10 can simply be represented using `log`.
	- if we have Y = log(y), M = log(b), C = log(a), then $\log(y) = \log(a) + x \log b \implies Y = C + Mx$, which is a linear equation.
- Log-log plot (power function): points are $(\log(x), \log(y))$
