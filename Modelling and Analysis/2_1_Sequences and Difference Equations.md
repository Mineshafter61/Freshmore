## Sequences
- List of numbers written in a definite order
- Length can be finite or infinite
- Graph of a sequence: isolated points with coordinates $(1, a_1), (2, a_2), ⋯, (n, a_n), ⋯$

### Function from sequence
- Write sequence using equivalent terms until an incrementing term pops up.

### Recursive sequences
- n-th term of recursive sequences depend on some of the terms that precede it.
Example: Fibonacci sequence

### Difference equations
- First-order difference equations: uses one preceding term.
- Second-order difference equations: uses two preceding terms. 
> $a_{n+1} = a + f(a_n) \implies Δ a_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$

Population size:
> $N_{t+1} = N_t + \text{inflow} - \text{outflow}$
> If the birth and death rates are constant, the equation will be:
> $N_{t+1} = N_t + \beta N_t - \mu N_t$
