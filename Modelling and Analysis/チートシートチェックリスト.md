Note: You **do not** have to have all the parts listed here in your cheatsheet; just having the parts you are unsure of will also work.

Note 2: Please try remembering and working out the equations before checking the answers by clicking on the spoilers. Remember, each second spent looking at your cheatsheet in the exam is a second you could have spent checking your answer later.

- [ ] Trigonometric equations (see note 1_4)
- [ ] Exponent laws
	> <details><summary>Spoiler alert</summary>
	> 
	> $a^nb^n=ab^n$ (also works for division)
	> 
	> $a^ma^n=a^{m+n}$ (also works for subtraction)
	> 
	> $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$
	> </details>
- [ ] Logarithm laws
	> <details><summary>Spoiler alert</summary>
	> 
	> $\log_am+\log_an=\log_amn$ (also works for subtraction+division)
	> 
	> $\log_am^k=k\log_am$
	> 
	> $\log_a(a^k)=k \implies \ln e^k=k$
	> 
	> $\log_ab=\frac{\ln b}{\ln a}$

- [ ] Conjugate method for evaluating fractions with square roots
	> <details><summary>Spoiler alert</summary>
	> 
	> $\frac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}}{c}=\frac{(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}) (\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})}{c (\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})}=\frac{a-b}{c (\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})}$
	> 
	> $\frac{\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}}{c}=\frac{(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}) (\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})}{c (\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b})}=\frac{a-b}{c (\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b})}$

- [ ] Techniques to solve sequences
	> <details><summary>Spoiler alert</summary>
	> 
	> Question asks what happens when the variable (let's call this variable n) approaches infinity
	> - Find $\lim_{n \to \infty} R(n)$ where R(n) is the recursive function given (or calculated).
	> - Remember that $\lim_{n \to \infty} R(n+1)=\lim_{n \to \infty} R(n)=\lim_{n \to \infty} R(n-1)$ as $\infty+1=\infty$.
