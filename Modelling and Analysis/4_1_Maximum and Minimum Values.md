## Absolute maximum/minimum
- $f(c)$ is the absolute maximum value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) ≥ f(x)$ **for all 𝑥 in 𝐷.**
- $f(c)$ is the absolute minimum value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) ≤ f(x)$ **for all 𝑥 in 𝐷.**
- $f(c)$ is the local maximum value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) ≥ f(x)$ **when 𝑥 is near 𝑐.**
- $f(c)$ is the local minimum value of $f$ on $D$ if $f(c) ≤ f(x)$ **when 𝑥 is near 𝑐.**
- If we say that something is **true** near 𝑐, we mean that it is **true on some open interval containing 𝑐**.
## Extreme value theorem
- If 𝑓 is continuous on a **closed interval $[a, b]$**, then **𝑓 attains a maximum value 𝑓(𝑐)** and an **absolute minimum value 𝑓(𝑑)** at some numbers 𝑐, 𝑑 in $[a, b]$ (𝑐, 𝑑 ∈ $[a, b]$).
- Note that an extreme value can appear more than once.
## Fermat's theorem
- If 𝑓 has a local maximum or minimum at 𝑐, and if $f'(c)$ exists, then $f'(c) = 0$.
- However, there may be extreme values where $f'(x)$ does not exist.
- **Critical number**: a number $c$ in the domain of a function $f$ such that either $f'(c)=0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist.
## Closed interval method
- To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function $f$ on a **closed interval* $[a, b]$:
	1. Find the values of $f$ at the critical numbers of $f$ in $[a, b]$.
	2. Find the values of $f$ at the endpoints of the interval. That is, find $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
	3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum.
