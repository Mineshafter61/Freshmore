## Sets
- Definition: collection of objects
- Notation: {elements...}
- ∪ Union
- ∩ Intersection
- ∅ Empty set

## Functions
- Definition: A rule that assigns each value x in a set D to a unique value denoted f(x) (Set R).
- Independent variable: x, described in Domain D.
- Dependent variable: y, or f(x), described in Range R.
- Domain: set of all independent values
- Range: is all values produced by the function
- x causes the denominator of function is 0 ↔︎ function is undefined at x.

## Graph of a function
- Definition: set of all points (x, y) in the xy-plane that satisfy the equation y=f(x)
- Graph is a function ↔︎ passes vertical line test
Example:
> D = {x1, x2, x3} implies
> R = {f(x1), f(x2), f(x3)}

## Arguments and Intervals
- Argument: expression on which the function works (x in f(x))
- Intervals: parts of the real line. For numbers a and b:
	- `[a, b]` = `a ≤ x ≤ b`
	- `(a, b)` = `a < x < b`
	- `(a, b]` = `a ≤ x < b`
	- `[a, b)` = `a ≤ x < b`

## Types of functions
- **Polynomials**: p(x) = a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ..., where n is a non-negative integer
	- Domain: ℝ, or (-∞, ∞)
	- [[1_1_Power functions]]
- **Rational functions**: f(x) = p(x)/q(x), where p and q are polynomials
- **Algebraic functions**: constructed using the operations of algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, roots). Even root → domain is nonnegative.
	- Property of $\sqrt{x}$: D, R = `[0, ∞)`
	- [[1_2_Root functions]]
- **Exponential function**: $f(x) = b^x$, where b ≠ 1 and b is a positive real number.
	- Natural exponential function is $f(x) = e^x$.
	- Natural logarithm function is $f(x) = ln(x)$.
- **Trigonometric functions**: $\sin{x}$, $\cos{x}$, $\tan{x}$, $\cot{x}$, $\sec{x}$, $\csc{x}$
- **Piecewise function**: different definitions on different parts of its domain.
	- [Graphing] Hollow dot: function is not defined at this point
	- [Graphing] Solid dot: function is defined at this point

## Properties of functions
- Increasing function: if x1 < x2, f(x1) < f(x2)
- Composite function 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 = 𝑓(𝑔(x))
	- g is the inner function
	- f is the outer function
- **Find domain of composite function**:
	- Simplify the composite function
	- Find Domain of outer function
	- Solve domain of outer function = inner function
	- Domain is the set of domain values that satisfy the above step

## Function symmetry
Symmetry about...
- y-axis: Graph has (x,y) → graph contains (-x, y).
- x-axis: Graph has (x,y) → graph contains (x ,-y).
- origin: Graph has (x,y) → graph contains (-x,-y).
- Graph is symmetric about both X- and Y-axes → graph is symmetric about origin
- Even function: f(-x) = f(x), symmetry about y-axis
- Odd function: f(-x) = f(x), symmetry about origin

## Slopes and lines
- Line through any two points: secant line
- Slope of secant line: $\frac{Δf(x)}{Δx}$, where h is horizontal change
