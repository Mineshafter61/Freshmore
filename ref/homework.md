(b) 
> Neon has the largest first IE, while magnesium has the smallest first IE. Since neon is a noble gas, its Z<sub>eff</sub> is the greatest, therefore the attractive force between its nucleus and outermost electrons is the greatest and hence it has the largest IE. Conversely, magnesium is in group II, hence its Z<sub>eff</sub> is the smallest among the three elements, therefore the attractive force between its nucleus and outermost electrons is the smallest and hence it has the smallest IE.

(c) 
> Neon has the most negative EA, while nitrogen has the least negative EA. Since neon is a noble gas in period II, its Z<sub>eff</sub> is the greatest, therefore the attractive force between its nucleus and an added electron is the greatest and hence it has the most negative EA. Conversely, magnesium is in group II, period III, hence its Z<sub>eff</sub> is the smallest among the three elements, therefore the attractive force between its nucleus and an added electron is the smallest and hence it has the least negative EA.

	(ii) London dispersion forces
(b)
(i) 
> As ethanol is a dipole, it experiences dipole-dipole interactions which is stronger than the London dispersion forces experienced by dimethyl ether. Therefore, ethanol has less molecules with sufficient kinetic energy to "break free" from its liquid phase by overcoming intermolecular attraction, resulting in a higher boiling point.

(ii) 
> As n-pentane has a more elongated shape than n-propane, there are more points at which dispersion forces act. Therefore, n-pentane has a higher boiling point.

### Question 1
(a)
$f_x(x,y)=5x^4y+y^4+y^3\cos x$
$f_y(x,y)=x^5+4y^3x+3y^2\sin x$

(b)
$g_x(x,y)=3y^9e^{3x}$
$g_y(x,y)=9y^8e^{3x}$
### Question 3
(a)
$f_x(x,y)=\frac{2}{2x+7y}$
$f_y(x,y)=\frac{7}{2x+7y}$
$\text{Tangent plane: } z=\ln 9+\frac{2}{9}(x−1)+\frac{7}{9}(y−1)=\ln9+\frac{2}{9}x+\frac{7}{9}y-1$

(b)
Let x = 1.1, y=0.9
$f(x,y)\approx \ln9+\frac{2}{9}(1.1)+\frac{7}{9}(0.9)-1=2.141669022$
